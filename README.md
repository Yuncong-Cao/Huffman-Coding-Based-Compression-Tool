# Huffman-Coding-Based-Compression-Tool
•   Developed a compression/decompression tool using Java, based on Huffman coding, capable of losslessly compressing files of any format and size, as well as folders of any depth. 
•   Operated via console commands for specifying input and output, continuously awaited new user commands, and displayed information such as compression time and rate. Allowed naming the compressed files, restoring original filenames upon decompression, and supported compressed file previewing.
